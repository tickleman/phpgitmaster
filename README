Beta Version 0.1 currently in development stage

This is a first pre-version you can use, with basic "active" features.

You've got :
- initialisation commands : init, clone
- supports .gitignore file
- common git workflow commands : fetch, commit, merge (without commit), push
- raw git checkout, status and log display on the web interface
- an API : a lot of usefull git PHP classes to enable an easy extend of this project

We need :
- git log detailled consultation (ie files contents and diffs)
- more merge options (preferred files, conflicts solving tool)
- more gracefull display (templating)
